<h1>Demo Portfolio</h1>
<p>This code working with localhost mysql, after download the code try to create first a database<br>
  <cod><pre>CREATE DATABASE portfolio;
        GRANT ALL ON portfolio.*TO'gazi'@'localhost'IDENTIFIED BY 'presheva123';
  </pre></code>
  After this the code will work for everyone if you want you can use your username and password or another database name but you need change some code like inside <code>new PDO()</code>
