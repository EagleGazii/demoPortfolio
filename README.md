<h1>Demo Portfolio</h1>
<p>Sorry for my English!</p>
<p>This code working with localhost mysql, after download the code try to create first a database<br>
  <cod><pre>CREATE DATABASE portfolio;
        GRANT ALL ON portfolio.*TO'gazi'@'localhost'IDENTIFIED BY 'presheva123';
  </pre></code>
  After this the code will work for everyone if you want you can use your username and password or another database name but you need change some code like inside <code>new PDO()</code>
</p>



<p>After you will download the code and you can show my design and others by using MAMP <br></p>

<h2>Why did I need to use php in portfolio?</h2>
<p >This is my demo one and in the future it will be like a portfolio-library</p>

<p>Some weeks later I will try to finish my idea about this project. And after that my project will look like :
  <br><pre><code>First page - you can login with an email or login as a guest
                  If you will choose login with email - after that your 
                  portfolio will open and you can change it however you want. 
                  If you will login as a guest - will be opened a second page,
                  in that page you will be able to saw all the portfolio that are 
                  in databese. And as a guest you can choose any of portfolio you want.
                  But as a guest you will never be able to change the data inside 
                  the any portfolio.
  </code></pre></p>


<p>I am new in PHP, I hope I will win my internship with php in starlabs :) Good luck!<p>
